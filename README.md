This raytracing engine was a project for the Interactions, Graphics and Multimedia course of my Master of Science in Computer Science at UDC (Spain). It is based on a simple engine provided by the professors, and we expanded its functionalities, with different shapes, lights, etc. Different predefined scenes can be rendered using command line arguments.


## Tools and execution

The project was developed with the following tools

- Python
- Numpy
- MatplotLib

To execute, simply run the following command line instruction: 
```
python raytracing.py -scene 1|2|3|4 -lights 1|2|3
```
